# Team-Project---Messaging-Subsystem-with-API-Integration 

## Overview
This project was developed for a university team projects module. The project we were assigned involved developing two subsytems, as well as a central API used by both to handle database interactions. This included a Data Analaytics subsystem and a Messaging subsystem. I played a large role in contributing to the development of all aspects of the Messaging subsystem, including front-end, back-end logic, and API requests.

## Key Features
The Messaging subsystem contains the following functionality:

- Send and receive messages between individual users
- Send and receive messages in group chats
- Message status tracking (delivered, opened)
- Live updates, enabling real-time receiving of messages
- Add users as friends
- API calls for all database interactions  

## Technologies Used
The Messaging subsytem uses the following technologies:

- HTML/CSS - For front-end elements and styling
- JavaScript - For front-end interactive features, and back-end functionality 
- PHP â€“ For session handling

The relevant API logic for database calls uses PHP and MySQL.
