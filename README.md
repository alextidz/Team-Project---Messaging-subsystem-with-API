# Team-Project---Messaging-Subsystem-with-API-Integration 

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a university team assignment. The objective was to build a modular system that uses a central API to handle all database interactions. The system is composed of two key subsystems:

Data Analytics Subsystem

Messaging Subsystem (this repository)

Each subsystem was responsible for interfacing with the API rather than interacting with the database directly.

Messaging Subsystem
This repository contains the Messaging Subsystem, which I was responsible for. It allows users to send, receive, and manage messages within the platform. All communication with the database is done via API calls to ensure a consistent and secure architecture.

Key Features
Send and receive user messages

Inbox and outbox views

Message status tracking (read/unread)

API-based interaction for all data operations

Technologies Used
PHP – for backend functionality and API integration

JavaScript – for client-side interactivity

MySQL – as the database solution (accessed via API)

HTML/CSS – for structure and styling
