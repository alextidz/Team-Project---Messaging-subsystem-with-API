# Team Project - Messaging Subsystem with API Integration 

## Overview
This project was developed for a university team projects module. The project we were assigned involved developing two subsytems, as well as a central API used by both to handle database interactions. This included a Data Analaytics subsystem and a Messaging subsystem. I played a large role in contributing to the development of all aspects of the Messaging subsystem, including front-end, back-end logic, and API requests.

## Key Features
The Messaging subsystem contains the following functionality:

- Send and receive messages between individual users
- Send and receive messages in group chats
- Message status tracking (delivered, opened)
- Live updates, enabling real-time receiving of messages
- Add users as friends
- API calls for all database interactions  

## Technologies Used
The Messaging subsytem uses the following technologies:

- HTML/CSS - For front-end elements and styling
- JavaScript - For front-end interactive features, and back-end functionality 
- PHP â€“ For session handling

The relevant API logic for database calls uses PHP and MySQL.

## Project Structure
Due to different organisational approaches between our development sub-teams during the project, the Messaging subsystem files are located directly in the root folder, while the Data Analytics subsystem files, and API files are contained within their own subfolders. This layout was kept for the final submission to ensure full functionality across the system.

## Note
This project was originally deployed and configured to run on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) server environment, which is no longer active, however the full project code is still here for review.
